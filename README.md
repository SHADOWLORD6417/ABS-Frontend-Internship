## Week-1: Create a webpage having 2 Sections and a navigation bar on Hotel
Created a web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The above project contains 4 sections(Header/Navbar, Room type, About us, and footer).
I have created 2 image sliders, out of which one is an automatic image slider whereas the other is a manual image slider.
